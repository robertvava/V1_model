    "Unsatisfying cell type dynamics - how to adjust weights appropriately? See HW Q1\\\n",
    "Retinotopic distance rule - overlapped LGN with V1, calculated distance, made probability of synapse function of that distance. Is this appropriate for every cell type (including Inh)?\\\n",

    "#### Homework questions\n",
    "Wasn't sure which dynamics params to use - might have contributed to runtime?\n",
    "Unclear on conversion from connection probability to synapse number / synaptic strength to weight\\\n",
    "Targeting perturbation to \"VIP\" neurons in simulation_config.json throws an error (other pop_names are fine)\\\n",
    "Tools for checking firing rate of population activity?\n",

    "#### Tutorial notes\n",
    "Sim 5 Tutorial - default setting is to run simulation_config.json, believe should be config.json\\\n",
    "Sim 5 Tutorial - LGN node connects to \"PV1\", should likely be \"PV\"\n"
